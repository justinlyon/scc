The values entered here will override any values that may be coming directly from Joomla own input boxes. Likewise, they will override any page title or description that may have been generated otherwise by sh404sef built in plugins.<br/>You usually will not have to use this section, as Joomla!, sh404sef and most extensions will create suitable page titles. Beware to create short and to the point page titles. Description should also be concise and clearly describe your page content. Better leave description empty if it does not bring value for visitors. Other meta elements can be setup by clicking on a url. Beware when you do so, as you may do more harm than good. In particular, you should probably leave Keywords meta data empty. They are not used by search engines, and under some circumstances can have a negative effect on your ranking."

Just enter 'component' instead of 'index', to start using it. <br/>You can also provide your own sub-template. Create it - let's say you call it 'error404.php', then store it in your template main directory, alongside index.php and component.php.
